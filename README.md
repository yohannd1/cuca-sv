## cuca-sv

Attempts at implementing the two CUCA architectures, created by [√Ålvaro
Degas](https://sites.google.com/site/alvarodegas/degas-home-page).

More info about it [around
here..?](https://sites.google.com/site/alvarodegas/degas-home-page/acad%C3%AAmico/disciplinas/2024-1/oac).

There are not formal written specs for these architectures, so I
aim to do that in the future (TODO).

## building / testing

At the moment I'm using [Icarus
Verilog](https://steveicarus.github.io/iverilog/) for everything, though
it doesn't work for synthesis. I'll think more about this later.
